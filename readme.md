# Malaysian Livestock and Crop Production Dashboard

## Overview
The **Malaysian Livestock and Crop Production Dashboard** is an interactive web application designed to analyze and forecast agricultural commodity production trends in Malaysia. This project integrates **data visualization**, **machine learning models**, and **time series forecasting** to provide actionable insights for stakeholders in the agricultural sector.

The dashboard combines **Power BI visualizations**, **KMeans clustering**, and **ARIMA forecasting** to deliver a comprehensive tool for understanding historical trends, identifying patterns, and predicting future production.

## How It Works
1. **Data Loading**: The application reads data from an Excel file containing historical production data for various commodities.
2. **KMeans Clustering**:
   - Calculates average production growth rates and volatility for each commodity.
   - Groups commodities into clusters based on their characteristics.
   - Displays the results in a scatter plot with annotations.
3. **ARIMA Forecasting**:
   - Builds ARIMA models for selected commodities.
   - Forecasts production for the next 10 years.
   - Displays historical data, forecasts, and model performance metrics.
4. **Power BI Dashboard**:
   - Provides an overview of production trends and key statistics.
